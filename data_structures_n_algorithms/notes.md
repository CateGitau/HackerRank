## How to Solve Problems
- Make sure you understand how to solve the problem before you start writting the code

The problem is defined by possible inputs and its relationshop between outputs

Steps:
 - Don't Panic
 - What are the inputs?
 - What are the outputs
 - Undertsand the relationship between the input and output - Some examples
 - Solve the problem!
 - Write the pseudo code/ simple mechanical solution(Don't optimize prematurely)
 - Develop solution incrementally and test as we go


## Efficiency/Complexity
This is how well you are using your computers resources to get the job done.

Algorithm - A series of steps to solve a problem


 input size sometimes affects the run-time of the program and sometimes doesn'tâ€”it depends on the program.


**Linear Relationship**
as the input increases, the number of lines executed increases by a proportional amount. Increasing the input by 1 will cause 1 more line to get run. Increasing the input by 10 will cause 10 more lines to get run. Any change in the input is tied to a consistent, proportional change in the number of lines executed. This type of relationship is called a **linear relationship**

**Quadratic rate of increase**
 If we have an input, nnn, then the number of operations will be n2n^2n2. This is what we would call a **quadratic rate of increase**

 Our code with the nested for loop exhibits the quadratic $n^2$ relationship on the left. Notice that this results in a much faster rate of increase.

 ### Order
 Big O Notation, and you'll see that the "O" in the name refers to the order of the rate of increase.


**Specify to your niterviewer which case you're talking about. Can be *best case*, *average case* or *worst case***

### Space Efficiency
When we refer to space complexity, we are talking about how efficient our algorithm is in terms of memory usage

**constant time space complexity**
**linear space complexity**
