## How to Solve Problems
- Make sure you understand how to solve the problem before you start writting the code

The problem is defined by possible inputs and its relationshop between outputs

Steps:
 - Don't Panic
 - What are the inputs?
 - What are the outputs
 - Undertsand the relationship between the input and output - Some examples
 - Solve the problem!
 - Write the pseudo code/ simple mechanical solution(Don't optimize prematurely)
 - Develop solution incrementally and test as we go
