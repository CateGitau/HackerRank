Finding the LCM
In this activity, using the following steps, you need to find the LCM of 24 and 36.

The steps are as follows:

Set a pair of variables as equal to 24 and 36.
Initialize the while loop, based on a Boolean that is True by default, with an iterator.
Set up a conditional to check whether the iterator divides both numbers.
Break the while loop when the LCM is found.
Increment the iterator at the end of the loop.
Print the results
